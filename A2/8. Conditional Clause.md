Apologies for misunderstanding. Here's your original message rewritten with corrections and adjustments in Markdown format:

## Real Condition
This is a sentence where something happens or you do something if a certain condition is met. For example:

```


```
Example:
Wenn es schneit, ziehe ich einen Mantel an.
```

```
which translates to:
if it snows, I will wear my coat.
```

The Formation Rule is ```
```
Wenn + Subject + Conjugated verb, Conjugated verb + Subject + ... + Infinitive
```
To form this type of sentence, we:

- Use "Wenn" at the beginning of the main clause.
- Place the conjugated verb after the subject in both clauses.
- The use of "denn" is optional and can be omitted without affecting the sentence structure.

## Unreal Condition
This is a sentence where the chance of something happening is low. For example:

```
Wenn (if) + subject + Konjunktiv II verb, subject + auxiliary verb (würde) + infinitive verb.
```

Example:

```
Wenn ich Zeit hätte, würde ich die Fenster putzen.
```

which translates to:

```
if I had time, I would clean the windows.
```

To form this type of sentence, we:

1. Place "Wenn" at the beginning of the main clause.
2. Use the Konjunktiv II form of the verb in the subordinate clause.
3. Follow the Konjunktiv II verb with the auxiliary verb "würde" and then the infinitive verb in the main clause.
4. Place the auxiliary verb "würde" in the second clause followed by the infinitive verb or the main verb in its respective conjugated form.
```
