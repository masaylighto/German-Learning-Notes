## Real Condition
This is a sentence where you do something or something happens if some condition is met. For example:

Wenn + Subject + Conjugate verb, Conjugate verb + Subject + ... + Infinitive

Wenn es schneit, (denn) ziehe ich einen Mantel an

which translates to:

if it snows, I will wear my coat

To form this type of sentence, we:

- use Wenn in the main sentence and put the model verb or the verb if there is no model verb as the first word in the second sentence
- also denn can be skipped from the sentence and it does not affect the order

## Unreal condition
This is a sentence where the chance of something happening is low. For example:

Wenn (if) + subject + Konjunktiv II verb, subject + auxiliary verb (würde) + infinitive verb.


wenn ich zeit hätte, würde ich die fenster putzen

which translates to:

if I had time, I would clean the windows

To form this type of sentence, we:

1. Place Wenn in the first of the main sentence  
2. Put the infinitive verb at the end of the sentence
3. After infinitive verb, put the model verb in Konjunktiv Case 
4. In the second sentence, put the model verb in Konjunktiv Case or the verb if there is no model verb as the first word in the second sentence
