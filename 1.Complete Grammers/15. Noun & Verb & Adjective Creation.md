#### Present  as Adjective
1. Infinitive +d +Adjective ending (Adjective declination)
	Das **lachende** Kind **spielt** im Garten. 
	The laughing child is playing in the garden.
	
The present participle tells you what the noun is doing at the moment (while the other action - the conjugated verb - is also going on). This is just like the "-ing" form of the verb in English.


#### Past Participle as adjective

**TODO** : Add rules

Ich verkaufe das **gebrauchte** Auto
I am selling the **used** car

The past participle, when used as an adjective, signals that the noun has a certain status/condition or describes an action that already occurred. This is done in English with the "-ed" ending**
