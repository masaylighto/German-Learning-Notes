#### 1. Infinitive +d +Adjective ending (Adjective declination)

**The present participle tells you what the noun is doing at the moment (while the other action - the conjugated verb - is also going on). This is just like the "-ing" form of the verb in English.**

- _„Das Kind lacht und spielt im Garten.“_
- _„Das **lachende** Kind **spielt** im Garten.” - "The laughing child is playing in the garden."_
