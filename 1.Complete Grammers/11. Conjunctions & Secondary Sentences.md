# Secondary Sentence 

 In German, we often need more than one sentence to fully express an idea. and as such we can have either multiple main sentences or one main sentence with multiple secondary sentences.
**Rules**
1. The main difference between main and secondary sentences is that a main sentence can stand alone and still convey a complete meaning.
2. Secondary sentences, on the other hand, cannot stand alone; their purpose is to clarify and enhance the meaning of the main sentence.
3. when main sentence preceded by the secondary sentence the verb of the main sentence will come at the first position 
**Further Explanations**
 Rule 1&2 Example
 Ich gehe spazieren, weil das Wetter schön ist.
 1. Main Sentence  
		 Ich gehe spazieren => can be meaningfull on its own: i go to walk
 2.  Secondary Sentence 
	 weil das Wetter schön ist => cant be meaningfull on its own=> because the weather is good: the sentence is lacking 
Rule 3
3. Weil das Wetter schön ist, gehe ich spazieren.
you see when the secondary sentence come first, the verb of the main sentence also become first
